# Distributed Quasi-Peer System for AI-Enhanced WebRTC

A scalable, fault-tolerant distributed system that provides AI-driven features for WebRTC-based video calling applications, including real-time transcription, translation, and meeting summarization.

## Features

- **Distributed Architecture**
  - Load-balanced quasi-peer servers
  - Automatic failover mechanisms
  - Horizontal scalability
  - Support for up to 50 participants per call

- **AI Capabilities**
  - Real-time speech-to-text transcription
  - Live multi-language translation
  - Post-meeting summarization
  - Adaptive processing based on network conditions

- **Media Processing**
  - Low-latency audio/video streaming
  - Adaptive bitrate control
  - Efficient media forwarding
  - Network bandwidth optimization

- **Security**
  - End-to-end encryption
  - Secure AI processing
  - Access control and monitoring
  - Data privacy compliance

## System Requirements

- Node.js >= 18.0.0
- Redis
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Kubernetes (for production deployment)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Configure environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
4. Start development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Development

- Build: `npm run build`
- Test: `npm run test`
- Lint: `npm run lint`
- Format: `npm run format`

## Docker Deployment

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## Kubernetes Deployment

1. Apply configurations:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f k8s/
   ```
2. Monitor deployment:
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -n quasi-peer-system
   ```

## Architecture

The system consists of multiple quasi-peer servers that work together to process and distribute media streams. Each server can:

- Handle WebRTC connections
- Process audio for transcription
- Perform real-time translations
- Generate meeting summaries
- Monitor system health
- Scale based on demand

## Configuration

Key configuration options are available in `config/` directory:

- Server settings
- AI model configurations
- Network parameters
- Security settings
- Scaling thresholds

## Monitoring

The system exposes Prometheus metrics for:

- Server health
- Media processing latency
- AI processing times
- Network bandwidth usage
- Participant counts
